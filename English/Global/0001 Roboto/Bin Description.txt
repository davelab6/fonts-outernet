About this bin
=========================

This bin was compiled by Dave Crossland. 

I believe it is essential that when we use digital tools, our freedom
to use, understand, modify and share these tools is respected.
Otherwise, when the tool does not work in the way that we need, we
will be unable to fix it.  Typeface designs are really tools, and
therefore these font files ought to be licensed in a way that respects
your freedom.

The Roboto fonts are licensed this way, under the Apache license (in
LICENSE.txt)

You are welcome to extend them to meet your needs, such as to add the
glyphs missing from your own writing systems.  If you do so, rename
the fonts to set apart your version from the originals.  To

What is in this bin?
=========================

This bin contains the Roboto font families. 

Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms
are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly
and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to
force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to
be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural
reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

There are 4 families, the normal family in regular and condensed
widths, a monospace variation, and the Roboto Slab family.

To use the fonts in webpages, Google Fonts is fast, easy and
free. Learn more at http://www.google.com/fonts


A Note on Roboto Mono
---------------------

Roboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the Roboto type family.  Like
the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for
readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading
environments.  While the monospaced version is related to its variable
width cousin, it doesn't hesitate to change forms to better fit the
constraints of a monospaced environment.  

For example, narrow glyphs like 'I', 'l' and 'i' have added serifs for
more even texture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight.  Curved
caps like 'C' and 'O' take on the straighter sides from Roboto
Condensed.

Special consideration is given to glyphs important for reading and
writing software source code.  Letters with similar shapes are easy to
tell apart.  Digit '1', lowercase 'l' and capital 'I' are easily
differentiated as are zero and the letter 'O'.

Punctuation important for code has also been considered.  For example,
the curly braces '{ }' have exaggerated points to clearly
differentiate them from parenthesis '( )' and braces '[ ]'.  Periods
and commas are also exaggerated to identify them more quickly.  The
scale and weight of symbols commonly used as operators have also been
optimized.
